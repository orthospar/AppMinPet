## Reading Ternary Diagrams



```{ojs}
import {ternarySlider} from '@yurivish/ternary-slider'

pc = d3.format('.0%')

viewof Composition = ternarySlider({
    value: [0.3, 0.2, 0.5],
    labels: ['MgO+FeO', 'Fe2O3', 'SiO2']
})
```

The pointer indicates a composition of:

- ${pc(Composition[0])} MgO + FeO,
- ${pc(Composition[1])} Fe~2~O~3~, 
- ${pc(Composition[2])}  SiO~2~
