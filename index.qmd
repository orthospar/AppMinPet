# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This lab manual covers the introductory topics for the Mineralogy and Petrology component of EART2231 - Earth Materials, for Semester 1 2023 at the University of Western Australia. This is not intended to be a comprehensive guide on these subjects, but a curated 'launch pad' from which we can direct you to further available resources.
