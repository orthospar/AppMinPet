## Cleavage/Fracture
Cleavage and Fracture are terms used to describe how the mineral *breaks*. If the mineral repeatedly breaks along a plane, and always in the same orientation(s), then the broken surface is termed a [:**cleavage**]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(crystal)). If the break is planar, but not repeatable, it is termed a [:**parting**]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(crystal)#Parting"). If the broken surface is not repeatable (it breaks in a different direction each time) it is termed a [:**fracture**]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_(mineralogy)"). 

### Cleavage

### Parting
Sometimes a crystallographic plane of weakness might arise due to structural defects in the crystal lattice. However, since this plane of weakness is not necessesarily *repeated* within the crystal structure (such as single twin plane), the crystal will not subsequently always break in the same direction, and it may not be present in every crystal. 

### Fracture
It is important to note that *all* minerals will have a fracture if broken in a direction that is not aligned with a cleavage orientationbecause the minerals cleave so readily!
