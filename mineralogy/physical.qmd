# Physical properties of minerals {.unnumbered}
Minerals have a wide range of physical properties that can be diagnostic for the identification of mineral species. We do not expect you to learn all of these properties off by heart for a given set of minerals -- it will come to you in time as you apply and practise your skills as a geologist. What you do need to know is *how* to identify each physical property, so that you can test a sample and look up matching candidates online. Below are the common/main techniques that a geologist is expected to know. We provide a bit more context and detail than what you have covered previously, but we have added plently of links to external resources for further reading.

## Colour
The colour of a mineral is simple to observe, but the root causes of colour in minerals is usually complicated (not even including how it is detected by the human eye, and subsequently interpreted by the human mind). For some minerals, colour is *diagnostic* -- that is to say that the mineral is that colour and that colour only. Two good examples of this are [azurite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azurite) and [malachite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachite), which are always blue and green, respectively. The colour of other minerals can vary wildy depending on trace element composition, structural defects or even microscopic inclusions -- [quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz) is a great example of this, ranging from colourless to yellow to black to purple to pink to green to red ... *and so on*...

## Lustre
[:Lustre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(mineralogy)) is the property of *how* a mineral reflects light. It should not be confused with colour, although the two are linked and often described togther. For instance, gold has a metallic lustre and is yellow in colour, whereas copper has a metallic lustre but is orange in colour. Try to avoid using terms that could be confusing... for instance, if you find a mineral that you think looks *silvery*, don't call it "silver", but describe it as "metallic white-grey". Something else to keep in mind is that lustre is very difficult to photograph and display correctly on a computer screen, and depending on the lighting conditions during photography lustre may not be captured at all. Common words to describe lustre include:

- metallic -- highly reflective, looks like metal (e.g., [:pyrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite), [:gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold), [:copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper))
- submetallic -- less reflective than metallic, because the mineral is a little bit transluscent (e.g., [:sphalerite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphalerite))
- dull or earthy -- looks like a matte finish, not glossy in any way (e.g., [:kaolinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaolinite))
- glassy/vitreous -- transparent/transluscent minerals that look like glass (e.g., [:quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz), [:olivine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine))
- adamantine -- transparent/transluscent minerals that *shine more* than you'd expect, like diamond. They have a high refractive index (e.g., [:cubic zirconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_zirconia))
- resinous -- transparent/transluscent minerals that *shine less* than you'd expect, like plastic or resin (e.g., [:amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber))  
- pearly -- reflective with a subtle *softness* to it, like a pearl or the inside of a shell (e.g., [:muscovite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovite))
- greasy -- looks like solid fat or grease (e.g., [:opal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal))
- waxy -- like greasy minerals, but often more opaque or coarser grained than greasy minerals (e.g., [:jadeite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadeite))
- silky - has a sheen like silk due to parallel alignment of microfibres (e.g., [:asbestos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos), [:ulexite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulexite))

There are also some other optical effects that are often distinctive, but not lustre *sensu stricto*. These tend to arise due to thin film intereference colours or oriented growth of micro inclusions, and include:

- iridescence/schiller effects -- strong colour play due to micro-scale platy minerals as inclusions or exsolution layers. There are some terms for very specific examples:
    - [:opalescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opalescence) -- lots of splotchy colours, like [:opal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal)
    - [:labradorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labradorite) -- very commonly displayed in plagioclase
    - [:adularescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adularescence) -- uncommonly (almost rarely) displayed in K-feldspars
    - [:aventurescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aventurescence) -- glittery inclusions in a transparent stone 
- [:chatoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatoyancy) -- usually something silky as parallel micro inclusions in something vitreous
- [:asterisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(gemology)) -- similar to chatoyancy, but the inclusions are aligned so that a 4- or 6-pointed star is seen. This is more important in gemmology, as the stones need to be cut [:*en cabochon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabochon) (it's not readily visible in raw/uncut material)


## Diaphaneity


## Cleavage/Fracture
Cleavage and Fracture are terms used to describe how the mineral *breaks*. If the mineral repeatedly breaks along a plane, and always in the same orientation(s), then the broken surface is termed a [:**cleavage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(crystal)). If the break is planar, but not repeatable, it is termed a *parting*. If the broken surface is irregular and not repeatable (it breaks somewhat randomly in a different direction each time) it is termed a [:**fracture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_(mineralogy)). 

### Cleavage


### Parting
Sometimes a crystallographic plane of weakness might arise due to structural defects in the crystal lattice. However, since this plane of weakness is not necessesarily *repeated* within the crystal structure (such as single twin plane), the crystal will not subsequently always break in the same direction. Importantly, partings may not be present in every crystal, which is why they are not considered a diagnostic feature. However, for minerals that have a solid solution series at high temperature but a solvus 

### Fracture
It is important to note that *all* minerals will have a fracture if broken in a direction that is not aligned with a cleavage orientationbecause the minerals cleave so readily!
