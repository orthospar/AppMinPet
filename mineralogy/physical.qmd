# Physical properties of minerals {.unnumbered}

## Colour

## Lustre

## Transparency/Opacity

## Cleavage/Fracture
Cleavage and Fracture are terms used to describe how the mineral *breaks*. If the mineral repeatedly breaks along a plane, and always in the same orientation(s), then the broken surface is termed a [:**cleavage**]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(crystal)). If the broken surface is not repeatable (it breaks in a different direction each time) it is termed a [:**fracture**]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_(mineralogy)"). It is important to note that *all* minerals will have a fracture if broken in a direction that is not aligned with a cleavage orientation. For minerals with many cleavage directions, fracture tends not to occur only because the minerals cleave so readily!
