    "text": "About this book\nThis is a lab manual created using Quarto markdown and executable code. It contains many interactive elements and is designed to be read within a browser with an internet connection, however a static version is also available in pdf or epub format.\nThe online version leverages a few extra features that are not typically found in textbooks. The first of these is a range of embedded interactive elements such as interactive plots and other visualisation tools, made possible through the use of Quarto. These will not work in the downloadable formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures in pdf and epub\n\n\n\nAs of 02 February 2023, figures rendered via ObservableJS (the interactive figures) are not built into the pdf or epub formats at all. This feature is slated for a future Quarto update (ETA: Mid 2023), where static versions of the figures will be automatically generated and inserted during document rendering. Until then, please refer to the online version for these figures.\n\n\nThe second feature is :Nutshell. Nutshell links are identifiable by their little : (colon) in front of the hyperlink. These links open the target site within the textbook itself, allowing seamless reading without jumping across multiple tabs. They also provide summary snippets and definitions, such as :Mineralogy or :Petrology. These will be used to provide further information, internal references to definitions, or links to other media (such as youtube videos). In the downloadable formats, Nutshell links will render as normal hyperlinks.\nThe third tool is Hypothes.is, which allows you to create public comment and discussion threads about the content on each page. You can also create your own private annotations. This does require an account to use, so it is up to you if you wish to join in or not. The hypothesis toolbar is located at the top-right of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is possible to add public annotations and comments to pdf and epub files via the hypothesis website, however these will not be integrated with comments on the main website. We encourage students to use the online version for use with Hypothesis."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis lab manual has been specifically tailored to the content taught during the first half of EARTH2231 - Earth Materials, at the University of Western Australia. We have arranged the material into the following parts:\n\nQuick Access\nIn this part we provide quick navigable access to some of the tables, graphs and process flow charts that you will use on a daily basis when doing any thin section microscopy (including sedimentary and metamorphic petrology, which we do not cover here).\n\n\nMineralogy\nIn this part we cover some introductory and basic principles of Mineralogy. We largely focus on crystallography and optical mineralogy, and the core concepts that you will be required to know for further Earth Science courses. Each chapter contains the requisite material for that week, i.e., Week 1 is Chapter 1. The only exception is the unnumbered chapter “Physical Properties of Minerals”, which is revisionary material (assumed knowledge from EART1104 - Discovering Earth). Don’t panic – we will cover this material as a ‘refresher’ during the lab in Week 1.\n\n\nPetrology\nIn this part we apply our new-found mineralogical skills towards the observation, description, and analysis of igenous rocks. Again, each chapter covers the material for the corresponding week."

    "text": "Correct Use of Microscopes\n\nAt the start of a session\n\nCarefully place the microscope on the bench, directly in front of you, and not placed too far back on the bench.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo: Always use two hands!\n\n\n\nAlways use two hands when picking up and moving the microscope – one hand on the neck at the back of the microscope, and one hand underneath the base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t: Grab the microcope by the head!\n\n\n\nThe head, stage and turrent of the microscope are not always secure, and are not designed to bear the full weight of the microscope.\n\n\n\nPlug in the power supply box. Make sure the dial is set to low voltage, and then turn it on. Slowly turn up the voltage to sufficient illumination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalogen bulbs\n\n\n\nThe light source is a halogen bulb, which is a kind of incandescent light source. As such, bulbs can ‘blow’ with sudden changes in voltage and temperature. Slowly turning up the voltage improves their life span… and makes it much less likely to blow during an exam!\n\n\nBefore you place a slide on the stage, using the lowest power magnification, check the following:\n\nUnder PPL check that the light is uniform with no shadows or obstructions.\nUnder XPL, check that the view is black. Not just a bit grey, and definitely not pink/purple!\n\n\n\nDuring a session\n\nAlways start at the lowest magnification\nChange to higher magnifications by holding the rim of the turret, not via the objective lenses.\nChange through the higher magnification lenses in order, and focus each lens before moving to the next\nPay close attention to the working distance at each magnification, make sure you do not focus the objective lens into the slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing at high magnification\n\n\n\nOnly use the fine focus control, particularly with 40x objective lenses or higher. The coarse focus will move the stage too much, and you risk pushing the objective lens through the stage, breaking the slide and damaging the lens.\n\n\n\nAlways switch back to the lowest power objective before removing or changing slides.\nOnly work on one slide at a time, and return the slide to the correct tray or drawer immediately when finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever leave the slide on the stage\n\n\n\nEven if you are only walking away for a few minutes, put the slide away (and turn off the power and put the cover on the microscope). Leaving slides on the microsope stage makes them unavailable to other students, and risks lose and/or damage to the slides if the microscope is packed up accidentally with the side still on the stage.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a session\n\nSet the objective lens to the lowest magnification\nRemove the slide, and store it where it belongs.\nTurn down the voltage on the power supply unit, then turn it off.\nPlace the dust cover back on top of the microscope.\nCarefully, using two hands, return the microscope to the cupboard."

If you suspect your microscope needs care and maintainence, let your instructor know and we can arrange to have it cleaned.\nWash your hands before using the microscope! Not only is this important for the management of repiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, but this helps to keep the microscopes clean and grime free.\nDo not eat or drink at your desk with the microscope out! Water is the only exception. If you want to have a coffee, or an energy drink, walk away from your desk and take 5-10 mins. This is also good for your eyes and posture.\nIf you are not actively using your microscope, turn it OFF and put the cover on! Dust is a menace and gets in there even if you are only gone for 10 mins."

Two good examples of this are azurite and malachite, which are always blue and green, respectively. The colour of other minerals can vary wildy depending on trace element composition, structural defects or even microscopic inclusions – quartz is a great example of this, ranging from colourless to yellow to black to purple to pink to green to red … and so on…"

    "section": "Lustre",
    "text": "Lustre\n:Lustre is the property of how a mineral reflects light. It should not be confused with colour, although the two are linked and often described togther. For instance, gold has a metallic lustre and is yellow in colour, whereas copper has a metallic lustre but is orange in colour. Try to avoid using terms that could be confusing… for instance, if you find a mineral that you think looks silvery, don’t call it “silver”, but describe it as “metallic white-grey”. Something else to keep in mind is that lustre is very difficult to photograph and display correctly on a computer screen, and depending on the lighting conditions during photography lustre may not be captured at all. Common words to describe lustre include:\n\nmetallic – highly reflective, looks like metal (e.g., :pyrite, :gold, :copper)\nsubmetallic – less reflective than metallic, because the mineral is a little bit transluscent (e.g., :sphalerite)\ndull or earthy – looks like a matte finish, not glossy in any way (e.g., :kaolinite)\nglassy/vitreous – transparent/transluscent minerals that look like glass (e.g., :quartz, :olivine)\nadamantine – transparent/transluscent minerals that shine more than you’d expect, like diamond. They have a high refractive index (e.g., :cubic zirconia)\nresinous – transparent/transluscent minerals that shine less than you’d expect, like plastic or resin (e.g., :amber)\n\npearly – reflective with a subtle softness to it, like a pearl or the inside of a shell (e.g., :muscovite)\ngreasy – looks like solid fat or grease (e.g., :opal)\nwaxy – like greasy minerals, but often more opaque or coarser grained than greasy minerals (e.g., :jadeite)\nsilky - has a sheen like silk due to parallel alignment of microfibres (e.g., :asbestos, :ulexite)\n\nThere are also some other optical effects that are often distinctive, but not lustre sensu stricto. These tend to arise due to thin film intereference colours or oriented growth of micro inclusions, and include:\n\niridescence/schiller effects – strong colour play due to micro-scale platy minerals as inclusions or exsolution layers. There are some terms for very specific examples:\n\n:opalescence – lots of splotchy colours, like :opal\n:labradorescence – very commonly displayed in plagioclase\n:adularescence – uncommonly (almost rarely) displayed in K-feldspars\n:aventurescence – glittery inclusions in a transparent stone\n\n:chatoyancy – usually something silky as parallel micro inclusions in something vitreous\n:asterisms – similar to chatoyancy, but the inclusions are aligned so that a 4- or 6-pointed star is seen. This is more important in gemmology, as the stones need to be cut :en cabochon (it’s not readily visible in raw/uncut material)"

Commonly this property is simply termed :transparency and translucency, but the term also includes the opposite of these – opacity. Transparent minerals allow light to transmit through them without scattering, i.e., it behaves like glass and you can ‘see through it’. Transluscent minerals allow light to transmit through them as well, however there is considerable scattering., i.e., you can see through it a bit, but the image is ‘cloudy’. Opaque minerals do not allow light to pass through at all. Minerals may be transparent, transluscent, or opaque, depending on crystal size, presence of inclusions, or minor and trace element contents."

    "text": "Cleavage/Fracture\nCleavage and Fracture are terms used to describe how the mineral breaks. If the mineral repeatedly breaks along a plane, and always in the same orientation(s), then the broken surface is termed a :cleavage. If the break is planar, but not repeatable, it is termed a parting. If the broken surface is irregular and not repeatable (it breaks somewhat randomly in a different direction each time) it is termed a :fracture.\n\nCleavage\n\n\nParting\nSometimes a crystallographic plane of weakness might arise due to structural defects in the crystal lattice. However, since this plane of weakness is not necessesarily repeated within the crystal structure (such as single twin plane), the crystal will not subsequently always break in the same direction. Importantly, partings may not be present in every crystal, which is why they are not considered a diagnostic feature. However, for minerals that have a solid solution series at high temperature but a solvus\n\n\nFracture\nIt is important to note that all minerals will have a fracture if broken in a direction that is not aligned with a cleavage orientation. However, fractures are not always easily seen because the minerals cleave so readily! While cleavage has both quality and orientation descriptions, due to the (semi)-random nature of fracture we do not describe the orientation of these breakages. We do still describe the quality of the break, with terms such as:\n\nConchoidal fracture – breaking in a curved and concave manner, often looking a little like the curved lines on a sea shell (hence the name, conch-oidal.) Normal glass breaks in this manner.\nsplintery\nhackly\nirregular – this is what safety glass has been designed to do (so you don’t get sharp flakes)"

However, eucryptite has a distinctive bright red short wave UV response, and sheelite has a very bright blue short wave UV response, while quartz is unresponsive to UV illumination.

    "text": "Further concepts\nThere are further techniques not covered here, such as obtaining an :optic figure and measuring the corresponding optic angle (or 2V). It is sufficient at this stage to know that they exist – we will cover this technique in a later course. There are also a few other concepts that the beginning microscopist should be aware of. These are covered in this section.\n\nColour perception\nWe all see the world differently, and this should not be a disadvantage when it comes to microscopy. Due to the different physical interaction properties of light between dyes and inks, LED/LCD computer screens, camera detectors, and how interference colours arise, it is not suprising that dramatic differences in perception of colours often arise between depictions of what is seen down the microscope versus what is actually observed, even in individuals with full colour perception.\nFigure Figure 2.2 is an :Ishihara colour perception plate. This is not a faithful reconstruction (due to colour rendering in various digital display technologies) but it is sufficient to illustrate the point here. You should be able to distinguish the number 74. If you see the number 71, or no number at all, then please alert your demonstrator so that we can help provide you with some extra materials and assistance. For instance, instead of using digitally rendered or print copied of the Michel Levy chart, we will provide you with a quartz wedge plate which can be viewed under cross polarised light to use as the true point of reference for the interference colours.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Ishihara Plate 9. The number 74 should be visible - please alert your demonstrator if you see the number 71 or no number at all.\n\n\n\n\nSources of Light\nAn important effect to take note of is how the generation of interference colours under cross polarised light is also a function of the spectral distribution of light interacting with the crystalline material. For the interference colours to behave as we expect them to as a function of birefringence, it is important to use an even a distribution of light as possible.\nModern :LEDs do not produce a uniform or continuous spectral distribution. Even the Nobel Prize winning blue LED and its subsequent combination with Ce-doped :YAG as a yellow phosphor still does not produce a sufficiently uniform spectrum suitable for XPL microscopy.\nAs such, our microscopes are equipped with :halogen bulbs, a modification to the standard tungsten-filament incandescent bulbs of the 20th Century. Yes, it’s old-tech, but it’s what we have. Notice in Figure Figure 2.3 that the light emitted from these bulbs is still skewed towards the yellow-red side of the spectrum. The microscopes compensate for this by filtering some of the yellow-red light to even out the distribution a little and make the general spectrum more ‘white’.\nThe key message is that the bulbs in your microscopes will produce a significant amount of infrared radiation (i.e., heat). Don’t leave them on for long periods unattended. When turning them on and off, it is best to start at low voltage and ramp it up slowly (over a couple of seconds) rather than just turn it on at full voltage. This increases wear on the bulbs, and makes them more likely to blow (which is not good if it happens during an exam).\n\n\n\n\nviewof TempK = Inputs.range(\n  [1500, 10000], \n  {value: 1700, step: 100, label: \"Temperature (K):\"}\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_bbspec = FileAttachment(\"bb_spectra.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  x: {label: \"Wavelength (nm)\"},\n  y: {\n    label: \"Relative Intensity\",\n    labelOffset: 0},\n  margin: 40,\n  marginBottom: 80,\n  style: {\n    background: \"#CCCCCC\",\n    fontSize: 20,\n    color: \"Black\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.image([{ url: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Linear_visible_spectrum.svg\"}],\n    {\n      x: 565,\n      y: -0.2,\n      width: 383,\n      height: width*0.1,\n      src: \"url\"\n    }),\n    //Plot.ruleX([380]),\n    //Plot.ruleX([750]),\n    Plot.areaY(filtered, { \n      x: \"wl\", \n      y: \"value\", \n      fill: \"hexvis\"})\n      \n      ],\n  width: 800\n})\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Relative spectral distribution of emissions for Black Body Radiation at a given Temperature.
