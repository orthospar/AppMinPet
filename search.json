    "text": "About this book\nThis is a lab manual created using Quarto markdown and executable code. It contains many interactive elements and is designed to be read within a browser with an internet connection, however a static version is also available in pdf or epub format.\nThe online version leverages a few extra features that are not typically found in textbooks. The first of these is a range of embedded interactive elements such as interactive plots and other visualisation tools, made possible through the use of Quarto. These will not work in the downloadable formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures in pdf and epub\n\n\n\nAs of 21 February 2023, figures rendered via ObservableJS (the interactive figures) are not built into the pdf or epub formats at all. This feature is slated for a future Quarto update (ETA: Mid 2023), where static versions of the figures will be automatically generated and inserted during document rendering. Until then, please refer to the online version for these figures.\n\n\nThe second feature is :Nutshell. Nutshell links are identifiable by their little : (colon) in front of the hyperlink. These links open the target site within the textbook itself, allowing seamless reading without jumping across multiple tabs. They also provide summary snippets and definitions, such as :Mineralogy or :Petrology. These will be used to provide further information, internal references to definitions, or links to other media (such as youtube videos). In the downloadable formats, Nutshell links will render as normal hyperlinks.\nThe third tool is Hypothes.is, which allows you to create public comment and discussion threads about the content on each page. You can also create your own private annotations. This does require an account to use, so it is up to you if you wish to join in or not. The hypothesis toolbar is located at the top-right of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is possible to add public annotations and comments to pdf and epub files via the hypothesis website, however these will not be integrated with comments on the main website. We encourage students to use the online version for use with Hypothesis."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis lab manual has been specifically tailored to the content taught during the first half of EARTH2231 - Earth Materials, at the University of Western Australia. We have arranged the material into the following parts:\n\nQuick Access\nIn this part we provide quick navigable access to some of the tables, graphs and process flow charts that you will use on a daily basis when doing any thin section microscopy (including sedimentary and metamorphic petrology, which we do not cover here).\n\n\nMineralogy\nIn this part we cover some introductory and basic principles of Mineralogy. We largely focus on crystallography and optical mineralogy, and the core concepts that you will be required to know for further Earth Science courses. Each chapter contains the requisite material for that week, i.e., Week 1 is Chapter 1. The only exception is the unnumbered chapter “Physical Properties of Minerals”, which is mostly revisionary material (assumed knowledge from EART1104 - Discovering Earth). Don’t panic – we will cover this material as a ‘refresher’ during the lab in Week 1.\n\n\nPetrology\nIn this part we apply our new-found mineralogical skills towards the observation, description, and analysis of igenous rocks. Again, each chapter covers the material for the corresponding week."

Make sure the dial is set to low voltage, and then turn it on. Slowly turn up the voltage to sufficient illumination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalogen bulbs\n\n\n\nThe light source is a halogen bulb, which is a kind of incandescent light source. As such, bulbs can ‘blow’ with sudden changes in voltage and temperature. Slowly turning up the voltage improves their life span… and makes it much less likely to blow during an exam!\n\n\nBefore you place a slide on the stage, using the lowest power magnification, check the following:\n\nUnder PPL check that the light is uniform with no shadows or obstructions.\nUnder XPL, check that the view is black. Not just a bit grey, and definitely not pink/purple!\n\n\n\nDuring a session\n\nAlways start at the lowest magnification\nChange to higher magnifications by holding the rim of the turret, not via the objective lenses.\nChange through the higher magnification lenses in order, and focus each lens before moving to the next\nPay close attention to the working distance at each magnification, make sure you do not focus the objective lens into the slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing at high magnification\n\n\n\nOnly use the fine focus control, particularly with 40x objective lenses or higher. The coarse focus will move the stage too much, and you risk pushing the objective lens through the stage, breaking the slide and damaging the lens.\n\n\n\nAlways switch back to the lowest power objective before removing or changing slides.\nOnly work on one slide at a time, and return the slide to the correct tray or drawer immediately when finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever leave the slide on the stage\n\n\n\nEven if you are only walking away for a few minutes, put the slide away (and turn off the power and put the cover on the microscope). Leaving slides on the microsope stage makes them unavailable to other students, and risks lose and/or damage to the slides if the microscope is packed up accidentally with the side still on the stage.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a session\n\nSet the objective lens to the lowest magnification\nRemove the slide, and store it where it belongs.\nTurn down the voltage on the power supply unit, then turn it off.\nPlace the dust cover back on top of the microscope.\nCarefully, using two hands, return the microscope to the cupboard."

Not only is this important for the management of repiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, but this helps to keep the microscopes clean and grime free.\nDo not eat or drink at your desk with the microscope out! Water is the only exception. If you want to have a coffee, or an energy drink, walk away from your desk and take 5-10 mins. This is also good for your eyes and posture.\nIf you are not actively using your microscope, turn it OFF and put the cover on! Dust is a menace and gets in there even if you are only gone for 10 mins."

Two good examples of this are :azurite and :malachite, which are always blue and green, respectively.

    "section": "Lustre",
    "text": "Lustre\n:Lustre is the property of how a mineral reflects light. It should not be confused with colour, although the two are linked and often described togther. For instance, gold has a metallic lustre and is yellow in colour, whereas copper has a metallic lustre but is orange in colour. Try to avoid using terms that could be confusing… for instance, if you find a mineral that you think looks silvery, don’t call it “silver”, but describe it as “metallic white-grey”. Something else to keep in mind is that lustre is very difficult to photograph and display correctly on a computer screen, and depending on the lighting conditions during photography lustre may not be captured at all. Common words to describe lustre include:\n\nmetallic – highly reflective, looks like metal (e.g., :pyrite, :gold, :copper)\nsubmetallic – less reflective than metallic, because the mineral is a little bit transluscent (e.g., :sphalerite)\ndull or earthy – looks like a matte finish, not glossy in any way (e.g., :kaolinite)\nglassy/vitreous – transparent/transluscent minerals that look like glass (e.g., :quartz, :olivine)\nadamantine – transparent/transluscent minerals that shine more than you’d expect, like diamond. They have a high refractive index (e.g., :cubic zirconia)\nresinous – transparent/transluscent minerals that shine less than you’d expect, like plastic or resin (e.g., :amber)\n\npearly – reflective with a subtle softness to it, like a pearl or the inside of a shell (e.g., :muscovite)\ngreasy – looks like solid fat or grease (e.g., :opal)\nwaxy – like greasy minerals, but often more opaque or coarser grained than greasy minerals (e.g., :jadeite)\nsilky - has a sheen like silk due to parallel alignment of microfibres (e.g., :asbestos, :ulexite)\n\nThere are also some other optical effects that are often distinctive, but not lustre sensu stricto. These tend to arise due to thin film intereference colours or oriented growth of micro inclusions, and include:\n\niridescence/schiller effects – strong colour play due to micro-scale platy minerals as inclusions or exsolution layers. There are some terms for very specific examples:\n\n:opalescence – lots of splotchy colours, like :opal\n:labradorescence – very commonly displayed in plagioclase\n:adularescence – uncommonly (almost rarely) displayed in K-feldspars\n:aventurescence – glittery inclusions in a transparent stone\n\n:chatoyancy – usually something silky as parallel micro inclusions in something vitreous\n:asterisms – similar to chatoyancy, but the inclusions are aligned so that a 4- or 6-pointed star is seen. This is more important in gemmology, as the stones need to be cut :en cabochon (it’s not readily visible in raw/uncut material)\n\n\nFuther Resources:\nDetermining Lustre by Donald B.

Commonly this property is simply termed :transparency and translucency, but the term also includes the opposite of these – opacity. Transparent minerals allow light to transmit through them without scattering, i.e., it behaves like glass and you can ‘see through it’. Transluscent minerals allow light to transmit through them as well, however there is considerable scattering., i.e., you can see through it a bit, but the image is ‘cloudy’. Opaque minerals do not allow light to pass through at all. Minerals may be transparent, transluscent, or opaque, depending on crystal size, presence of inclusions, or minor and trace element contents."

    "text": "Habit\nThe :habit of a mineral describes how it has grown. There are many different terms that can be used to describe growth habits, but a simple place to start is with words used to describe single crystals versus words used for clusters/groups of minerals.\n\nSingle Crystals\nFor single crystals, we describe two separate observations: 1. How well the crystal faces are developed, and 2. the overall 3D shape.\n\nIn an ideal situation, a mineral will grow with well defined crystal faces that reflect the internal structure of the crystal lattice (more on this in Crystallography). We have three terms to describe if this has occured in any given sample:\n\n\nEuhedral – a single crystal has managed to grow into a perfect representation of its crystal structure and has well developed crystal faces.\nSubhedral – some crystal faces are well developed, but not all.\nAnhedral – no crystal faces have developed.\n\n\nThe general shape can also be descibed, and combined with the terms above. This is particularly useful as these terms can start to provide hints on what crystal system the mineral might belong to (again, more on this in Crystallography). There are many different terms used here, some common/basic use terms include:\n\n\nEquant – more or less the same measurements in all directions\nPlaty – little sheets or plates, very thin in one direction\nAcicular – little needles, very thin in two directions\nPrismatic – like a prism (in the geometry sense), longer in one dimension than the other two\n\n\n\nGroups of crystals\nHow minerals grow togther is another useful property to describe. Some common examples include:\n\nDruse or Drusy – small crystals growing over the surface of a larger crystal\nMassive or Compact – a large mass of small (&lt;&lt;1 mm) crystals where individual crystal shapes cannot be determined\nBotryoidal – small grape-like clusters\nColloform – a circular or curved/wavy banded habit"

    "title": "Physical properties of minerals",
    "section": "Cleavage/Fracture",
    "text": "Cleavage/Fracture\nCleavage and Fracture are terms used to describe how the mineral breaks. If the mineral repeatedly breaks along a plane, and always in the same orientation(s), then the broken surface is termed a :cleavage. If the break is planar, but not repeatable, it is termed a parting. If the broken surface is irregular and not repeatable (it breaks somewhat randomly in a different direction each time) it is termed a :fracture.\n\nCleavage\nWhen describing cleavage, there are two things to look out for: The quality of the cleavage and the number of cleavage planes\n\nThe Quality of a cleavage describes how easily the mineral breaks along that plane, and is often easily determined by how well the surface reflects light.\n\nPerfect cleavage often has a highly reflective (i.e., smooth) surface and the mineral will very easily break along this plane. E.g., Muscovite\nGood cleavage will not break as easily as perfect cleavage, and the surface is mostly smooth.\nPoor cleavage is often harder to see, the surface will be more rough than smooth. Sometimes you need to be specifically looking for it to find it.\nIndistinct cleavage is practically not discernable, but may be noticed as a general tendency for fractures to break in the same direction (usually in thin section under a microscope)\nNone refers to no cleavage at all!\n\nThe Number of cleavages describes how many different cleavage orientations there are (not the number of sheets in a mica crystal, for example). We can use the number of cleavage planes, along with orientation terms to describe how they are related to each other:\n\n1 cleavage plane is also described as Basal cleavage if there is only one orientation in the crystal where cleavage occurs, or Pinacoidal if it occurs in combination with a prismatic cleavage\n2 cleavage planes are can described as Prismatic. The angle between these two planes can be diagnostic (see for example pyroxenes vs amphiboles).\n3 cleavage planes are either described as Cubic cleavage if all three planes are perpendicular to each other, or Rhombohedral if they are all at some other angle. Galena is an example of cubic cleavage, whereas calcite is an example of rhombohedral cleavage.\n4 cleavage planes are typically Octahedral in orientation. An example of this is fluorite.\n6 cleavage planes is also called Dodecahedral. This is typical of sphalerite.\n\n\nIf in doubt, just count the number of cleavages you can see, and describe their orientation to each other as best as possible.\n\n\nParting\nSometimes a crystallographic plane of weakness might arise due to structural defects in the crystal lattice. However, since this plane of weakness is not necessesarily repeated within the crystal structure (such as single twin plane), the crystal will not subsequently always break in the same direction. Importantly, partings may not be present in every crystal, which is why they are not considered a diagnostic feature. However, for minerals that have a solid solution series at high temperature but a solvus\n\n\nFracture\nIt is important to note that all minerals will have a fracture if broken in a direction that is not aligned with a cleavage orientation. However, fractures are not always easily seen because the minerals cleave so readily! While cleavage has both quality and orientation descriptions, due to the (semi)-random nature of fracture we do not describe the orientation of these breakages. We do still describe the quality of the break, with terms such as:\n\nConchoidal fracture – breaking in a curved and concave manner, often looking a little like the curved lines on a sea shell (hence the name, conch-oidal.) Normal glass breaks in this manner.\nsplintery – breaks into long thin random splinters\nhackly – a rough breaking surface, like if you snap a piece of metal.\nirregular – this is what safety glass has been designed to do (so you don’t get sharp flakes)\n\n\nFurther Resources:\nDetermining Fracture and Cleavage by Donald B.

To determine density qualitatively, one simply needs to ‘feel’ the weight and use their own judgement to gauge whether or not a mineral is ‘light’, ‘heavy’, or ‘average’. This requires practice and skill… use the example mineral sets to ‘get a feel’ for how density varies between minerals.\nQuantitatively, density can be measured and reported as either ‘Density’ in units of g/cm^3 (that is mass per unit volume), or as ‘Specific Gravity’ (abbreviated SG) which is the density of a sample divided by the density of water. Numerically these values are more or less equivalent (since the density of water is ~1 g/cm^3) but SG is unitless.\nWe do not often need to calculate these values, particularly since SG is only a useful diagnostic in single crystals (and ones large enough to measure properly).\n\nFurther Resources:\nDetermining SG of a mineral by Donald B.

Like density, Hardness can also be determined quantitatively or qualitatively. There is are specific hardness scales that have SI units (:Vickers Hardness, :Knoop Hardness, :and others), but in Geology we like to use the :Mohs Hardness scale. It is defined relative to an index of 10 minerals:\n\nTalc\nGypsum\nCalcite\nFluorite\nApatite\nOrthoclase Feldspar\nQuartz\nTopaz\nCorundum\nDiamond\n\nThese minerals are defined to have precicely these hardnesses. Other minerals are equal to these values ONLY IF the index mineral can scratch the test sample and the test sample can scratch the index mineral. If a mineral has a hardness between two of these index minerals, it may be reported as between two values, such as hardness 4-5. Often this is abbreviated to a hardness of 4.5, for example. Note that we do not go further than this – we would not try to describe something as 4.25 or 4.75.\nQualitatively, your fingernail has a Moh’s hardness of ‘2.5’, so if you can scratch it with your fingernail it is ‘soft’. You may have a quartz (Mohs 7) point on you for testing mineral hardness, at which point if you cannot scratch your unknown sample with quartz it is ‘hard’. If you are using a scribe with a tungsten-carbide tip, it will scratch just about everything but one can get a feel for how much effort is required to get a ‘good scratch’.\n\nFurther Resources:\nDetermining Hardness by Donald B.

For instance, SiO2 can crystallise in multiple different crystal structures – Quartz (SiO2) is a common mineral formed in a range of environments on Earth, but stichovite (SiO2) is a very high pressure and temperature mineral found only in meteorite impact craters.

At least one full stoichiometric set of atoms that make up that mineral are arranged in some manner within the unit cell (in often complicated arrangements), but the unit cells themselves can only stack together in a limited number of ways.\nIn order to describe the size and shape of the unit cell for a given mineral, we could use normal cartesian x-y-z coordinates. However, since some unit cells are not always cubes or rectangular prisms (they can have angles other than 90°) we instead describe the three edge lengths and call these directions the a-b-c axes.\nAs mentioned, the angles between the a-b-c axes are not always 90°.

    "text": "Symmetry Elements\nSymmetry elements are discrete mathematical translation and rotation operations that allow a unit cell to tesselate without any overlap into a infinitely repeating crystal structure. There are 3 main symmetry elements to be aware of:\n\nMirror Planes These are quite simply an imaginary plane that cuts a crystal in half, where each half is a mirror image of the other.\nRotation Axes These are an imaginary axis about which the crystal is rotated, and the order of symmetry is a count of how many times the mineral rotates through an identical starting arrangement through 360°. The possible orders of rotation axes are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold and 6-fold.\nCenter of Inversion A center of inversion is an imaginary point in the exact middle of the crystal, through which a point, edge, or face of the crystal may be projected through to the other side. The most useful observation here is usually the absence of a centre of inversion.\n\nThe 7 crystal systems can be defined by their unit cell dimensions and the symmetry operations that are possible for that system. These are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem\nAxis lengths\nAxis angles\nMinimum symmetry requirements\n\n\n\n\nIsometric\na=b=c\nα=β=γ=90°\nFour 3-fold rotation axes\n\n\nTetragonal\na=b≠c\nα=β=γ=90°\nOne 4-fold rotation axis\n\n\nOrthorhombic\na≠b≠c\nα=β=γ=90°\nThree 2-fold rotation axes\nOR\n2 mirror planes and a 2-fold rotation axis\n\n\nMonoclinic\na≠b≠c\nα=γ=90°, β≠90°\nOne 2-fold rotation axis\nOR\n1 mirror plane\n\n\nTriclinic\na≠b≠c\nα≠β≠γ≠90°\nNone\n\n\nTrigonal\na=b≠c (a1=a2=a3≠c)\nα=β=90°, γ=120°\nOne 3-fold rotation axis\n\n\nHexagonal\na=b≠c (a1=a2=a3≠c)\nα=β=90, γ=120°\nOne 6-fold rotation axis\n\n\n\n\nFurther Details:\nCrystal Symmetry"

    "section": "The Miller Index",
    "text": "The Miller Index\nA 3-dimensional crystal may have many different crystal faces, edges, and points. The :Miller Index is a useful descriptive system based upon the unit cell dimensions. For a given unit cell a-b-c, we can define coordinates h-k-l such that the plane (100) (read as one-zero-zero, where h = 1, k = 0, l = 0) is perpendicular to the a-axis but parallel to the b and c axes.\nThe correct mathematical description of Miller Indicies is often confusing, but a simple way to think of it is how many times does the plane intercet the unit cell dimensions? In our example above, (100), the plane cuts the a-axis only once, and doesn’t cut the other two axes (hence parallel to b and c). If the miller index was (210), the plane cuts the unit cell twice along the a-axis dimension (i.e., it cuts it in half) for every one time it cuts the unit cell along the b-axis dimension, and still remains parallel to the c-axis dimension.\nThe other important feature of the Miller Index is the use of brackets. Curved brackets () denote a a single plane, such as (100), whereas curled brackets {} denote a set of planes related by crystal symmetry, such as {100} which means the full set of 6 faces perpendicular to each axis. Finally, square brackets [] denote a direction, such that [100] is equivalent to the a-axis.\n\nFurther Details:\nMiller Index"
