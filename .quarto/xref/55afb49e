Each order of interference colours can be counted as the troughs pass by 551 nm (marked by vertical line). The boundary between 1st and 2nd order colours occurs at a birefringence of 0.018 as the first trough passes this line. Higher order colours (after 3rd order) oscillate between weak pink-green colours and become increasingly washed-out and pale. This spectral curve has been generated in R from first principles and is converted into an estimation of the perceived colour using the pavo 2 package [@Maia2013; @Maia2019].","key":"fig-int_spectra"},{"order":{"section":[2,3,2,0,0,0,0],"number":3},"caption":"Top: Relative spectral distribution of emissions for Black Body Radiation at a given Temperature.

Bottom: The same curve with interference calculated as a function of birefringence. Notice how the interference colours can appear different depending on the intial spectrum of light.
